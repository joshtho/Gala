## Save your favorite artists and artworks

Galla is a web application where you can save information on your favorite artists and their artworks. Each artwork will have information saved about the piece such as medium and location. Your image of the artwork will come in a card with a notes section on why you like the artwork. The homepage will show a carousel of your saved art. The Artists tab will show artists added by other users and give you the option to save one of their artworks into your own collection. 

This application was made with a Ruby on rails API backend and a React js frontend, aided by Redux toolkit used for state manangement across the application.
